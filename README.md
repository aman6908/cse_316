In the dynamic field of operating systems and computing, effective task scheduling is paramount to ensure optimal resource utilization and improve system performance. The current algorithm  is a good example of a non-preemptive schedule similar to the well-known "Shortest Job Next". concept However, it adds a unique twist to the table by considering process and waiting time when calculating priority. This improvement prevents tasks from being postponed indefinitely, as processes that have waited longer are given a higher priority,  creating a fair and balanced scheduling system.   The core of this planning mechanism revolves around process and priority calculation. The priority value is determined based on the ratio between the expected time of visit and the waiting time using the formula: Priority = 1 + (Waiting Time /  Burst Time). This formula reflects the idea that when processes are queued, their priority gradually increases, eventually ensuring  fair performance for them.   This C program, carefully designed to implement this innovative scheduling algorithm, provides a practical exploration of the concept. In particular, it includes the following functions:    1. Dynamic User Input: Users can dynamically input information about the number of processes,  arrival times and burst times, creating a versatile and interactive planning environment.   2. Real-time priority visualization: The program shows the priority of each process after each time unit, allowing users to monitor the change of priorities during execution. 
 3.Calculation of individual and average waiting time: at the end of planning, the program provides detailed information about the waiting times of each process and calculates the average waiting time, which is the main indicator to evaluate the efficiency of the planning algorithm.
